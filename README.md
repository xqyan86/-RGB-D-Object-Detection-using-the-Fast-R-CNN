# RGB-D Object Detection using the Fast R-CNN
This was a course project of Deep Learning(DL). The project is based on the Fast R-CNN.

Introduction

In this project, we study the problem of object detection for RGB-D images using the Fast R-CNN. Unlike the RGB modality, there is no powerful ImageNet pre-trained models, which play key role in achieving remarkable detection results. To solve this problem, we study two simple encoding schemes for the depth modality in order to borrow an ImageNet pre-trained model. We further investigate how to combine the two modalities. Experimental results show that using an ImageNet pre-trained model for the depth modality significantly improves the detection results. Furthermore, after combining the RGB and depth information, better performance can be achieved than simply using single of them.
