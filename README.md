# RGB-D Object Detection using the Fast R-CNN
This was a course project of Deep Learning(DL). The project is based on the Fast R-CNN.

Mainwork:

◦ Investigated two simple encoding schemes for the depth modality to use an ImageNet pre-trained model.
◦ Combined RGB and depth modalities using average score and joint training to achieve better detection results.
